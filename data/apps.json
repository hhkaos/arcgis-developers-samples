This pattern is great for small, high-value UI elements, but it’s not recommended for thousands of items due to performance limitations.",

A RenderNode gives low-level access to the SceneView’s WebGL context, letting you create custom 3D visualizations that behave like built-in layers. In this example, a custom RenderNode animates rotating windmills directly in the scene",
